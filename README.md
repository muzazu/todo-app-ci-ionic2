### Summary of Main Idea
Connecting between prof and group of students, monitoring what they do in the group so the prof will be easier to give final result (exam result / assignment / homework) for individual student.

### API CodeIgniter 2.xx
It's just young of me tryin to understand API, how API works etc and it's really bad practice cuz the deadline of this course or i'm just too lazy (LOL).
I **don't recomend** to use this as base for your example app, still need more improvement there and there.

#### API Features
* No migration
* Generating JWT never use it
* No ORM

### Ionic App for mobile
It's f***in horrible never try to install it.
 
### Web App for Admin
**i can't find it, hashtag pressF**

### Conclusion
This was made for my homework / course assignment, just wanna save this for later / history / maybe this will humiliate myself in the future / i don't know.
